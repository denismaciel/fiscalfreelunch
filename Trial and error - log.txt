Problem: Different values of xip is not affecting the simulation
Did not work:

1. Changed the parameters of Taylor Rule to "normal" (0.2 and 1.5). Why: Maybe the inflation was not responding because CB was too aggressive.

2. Maybe the code of the second simulation was not work. But it is. I tested changing the value of sig_con and and it had clear effects on the simulation.

Worked: If you change the values of xip from 1 to 0.2 in the beginning of the code, inflation varies. The problem seems to be with the two simulations inside the same code. 

In fact, the problem is with second simulation within the code. I simulated the model with two different values of alpha and it had no effects on the results. It seems that you can only change the __size__ of the shock for the double simulation to work. 


It works only with sig_con because the only code that is rerun in the double simulation is the following:


``` js
//Set different value for xip and run the model again
sig_con=1000;
//standard deviations of shocks
shocks;
var eps_con;
periods 1:1;
values(sig_con); 
end;
//stochastic simulation
simul(periods=40); 
//save irfs 
irfs_xip2 = oo_.endo_simul;
```
